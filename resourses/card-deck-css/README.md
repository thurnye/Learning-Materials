### What is this? ###
- Cardstarter.css has a bunch of classes such as ".card.h09" (9 of hearts) and ".card.sA" (ace of spades) and ".card-back-blue" (back of card - blue deck) and ".card-back-red"
- You can use these for example by doing &lt;div class="card d10"&gt;. Check out the <a href="card-deck-example.html">example rendering</a> to see how to use them in more detail.

### How to use our card styles: ###
- Download the "card-deck-css/" folder. Make sure your html file that will render cards is at the same level of the "card-deck-css/" folder NOT not inside it.
- These classes correspond to images in the images/folder
- There are also styles for rotating cards - check out the <a href="card-deck-example.html">example rendering</a> to see how to use them in more detail.

So yeah, you can have beautiful looking cards by just adding a class to something.
